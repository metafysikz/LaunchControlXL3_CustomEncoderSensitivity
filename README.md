# LaunchControlXL3_CustomEncoderSensitivity
This repository contains a modified MIDI Remote Script for the Novation Launch Control XL 3. It fixes the sluggish "slow-turning" behavior of the encoders in DAW mode, allowing for fast, 1-turn sweeps from 0% to 100%—essential for live performance, dub-style mixing, and quick parameter adjustments.
